        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>
          Daniel Davidson’s story is rooted in hard work, responsibility, and a deep commitment to family.
          He was born in Blytheville, Arkansas on an Air Force base and raised in Sullivan, Missouri,
          where he grew up around a traditional country lifestyle on a working farm.
        </p>

        <p>
          Early on, he learned discipline through daily chores, caring for animals, and following through.
          After his parents divorced during his teenage years, he stepped into a more serious role at home,
          which shaped how he views responsibility and leadership.
        </p>

        <p>
          His parents both influenced his character.
          His father modeled strength and determination.
          His mother showed persistence and sacrifice through her work ethic.
          Those lessons carried into Daniel’s values today, including honesty, loyalty, and accountability.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of work, he enjoys time outdoors.
          Hunting, fishing, hiking, and wake surfing are the kind of activities that help him recharge.
          His long term goal is building something meaningful that can be passed down to his children.
